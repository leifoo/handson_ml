    "## Chapter 10. Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea inspired _artificial neural networks_(ANNs): study brain's architecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are the very core of Deep Learning. They are versatile, powerful, and scalable, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Biological to Artificial Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNS first introduced as _propositional logic_ in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in ANNs as new network architectures were invented and better training techniques were developed. But by the 1990s, powerful alternative Machine Learning techniques such as\n",
    "Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to believe this wave of interest in ANNs is different and will have a much more profound impact on our lives:\n",
    " - Huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and ANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex problems.\n",
    " - Computing power (Moore's Law, GPUs)\n",
    " - The training algorithms have been improved.\n",
    " - Some theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice.\n",
    " - ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous circle of funding and progress.\n",

    "#### Biological Neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron typically connected to thousands of other neurons. Highly complex computations can be performed by a vast network of fairly simple neurons.\n",

    "_Artificial neuron_: one or more binary (on/off) inputs and one binary output. (Such simplified model can build a network of artificial neurons that computes any logical proposition.)\n",

    "#### The perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "*Perceptron*: one of the simplest ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. It is based on a slightly different artificial neuron called a _linear threshold unit_ (LTU): the inputs and output are now numbers (instead of binary on/off values) and each input connection is associated with a weight.\n",

For every output neuron that produced a wrong prediction, it reinforces the connection weights from the inputs that would have contributed to the correct prediction. The rule is shown as\n",

    "functions by a shared _softmax_ function. The output of each neuron corresponds to the estimated probability of the corresponding class.

    "### Fine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Any _network topology_, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, type of activation function, weight initialization logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is much better to use randomized search over grid search. Another option is to use a tool such as Oscar (http://oscar.calldesk.ai/), which implements more complex algorithms to help you find a good set of hyperparameters quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP with just one hidden layer can model even the most complex functions provided it has enough neurons. However, deep networks have a much higher parameter efficiency than shallow ones: they can model complex functions using exponentially fewer neurons than shallow nets, making them much faster to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and DNNs automatically take advantage of this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good solution, it also\n",
    "improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and it will work just fine. For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp up the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very complex tasks, typically require networks with dozens of layers (or even hundreds, but not fully connected ones), and they need a huge amount of training data. However, you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to reuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task. Training will be a lot faster and require much less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of Neurons per Hidden Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the hidden layers, a common practice is to size them to form a funnel, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer - the rationale being that many low-level features can coalesce into far fewer high-level features. However, this practice is not as common now, and you may simply use the same size for all hidden layers. Just like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the number of neurons gradually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will get more bang for the buck by increasing the number of layers than the number of neurons per layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you actually need, then use _early stopping_ to prevent it from overfitting (and other regularization techniques, especially _dropout_). This has been dubbed the “stretch pants” approach: instead of wasting time looking for pants that perfectly match your size, just use large stretch pants that will shrink down to the right size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden layers (or one of its variants). It is a bit faster to compute than other activation functions, and Gradient Descent does not get stuck as much on plateaus, thanks to the fact that it does not saturate for large input values (as opposed to the logistic function or the hyperbolic tangent function, which saturate at 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the output layer, the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for classification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive). For regression tasks, you can simply use no activation function at all."
